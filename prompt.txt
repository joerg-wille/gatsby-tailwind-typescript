I want to continue working on a website project.
It uses gatsby.js framework, yarn as the build system, TypeScript as the preferred programming language and uses Tailwind for styling. The content is provided as markdown files using mdx.
Here is my code for a minimal starter gatsby project: https://github.com/joerg-wille/gatsby-tailwind-typescript.git
In the next step I want to add content and additional functionalities for a professional looking website. The purpose of the website is to present and to sell a single condominium.
Technically the site will be a single page website with infinite scroll, a floating menu on the top and an image carousel.
Follow my steps:
1. Analyse my existing source code from my github account: https://github.com/joerg-wille/gatsby-tailwind-typescript.git
2. Add code and all required changes to add a fullscreen background image. Use gatsby-image to make it responsive. 
Use an arbitrary free image from internet which shows the front site of a high quality renovated town house from the founding period.
3.  Add code and all required changes for adding a infinite scrolling panel in the middle of the screen using 75% of the entire screen. The panel should be white and semi translucent (80%). Add fictional but meaningful example content for selling a condo.
4. Add source code and all required changes for a floating menu with 4 links: Informationen, Grundriss , Fotos, Kontakt
The menu should be on top, have a white backgound
